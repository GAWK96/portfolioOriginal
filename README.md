Here, you can find all the projects that I made so far. In my opinion, create projects and to code "by my own " is the best way to put in practice the theory that I've learned in the courses that I took/have been taking. With the exception of the project: PROJECT 4 - MUSEUM OF CANDY, all of the others I did by myself.
